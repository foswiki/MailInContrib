---+ Templates for the MailInContrib

*DO NOT MODIFY THIS TOPIC*

This is a normal topic, but it is also a template file, as described in %SYSTEMWEB%.SkinTemplates. It contains the template definitions used by the MailInContrib to insert mail messages in topics.

Each template is specified in the form of a pair of template definitions, (surrounded by verbatim tags below for readability). The template to use when inserting incoming mail in a topic is decided from the parameters in the =&lt;--MAIL--> comment in the topic. The default template is =normal=.

<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{MAILIN:normal}%   * *%SUBJECT%*: %TEXT% -- %WIKIUSERNAME% - %SERVERTIME%%ATTACHMENTS%
%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>

=%<nop>ATTACHMENTS%= in the previous template will be expanded to a list of attachments that came in the mail. Each attachment in the list is formatted by the following template:
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{MAILIN:normal:ATTACHMENT}%      * %A_FILE%
%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>

*DO NOT MODIFY THIS TOPIC*

If you want to modify or add any templates, create the topic %SYSTEMWEB%.MailInContribUserTemplate. This topic is automatically included here if it exists, but it is *not* shipped with the MailInContrib. You can create this topic in individual webs, as described in %SYSTEMWEB%.SkinTemplates. In this case the template will only apply in that specific web.

<!-- The following line includes a *template* called "MailInUserContrib", which the template search rules automatically resolve to a *topic* called MailInContribUserTemplate. -->
